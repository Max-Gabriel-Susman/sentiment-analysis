It's in a mall so atmosphere is irrelevant. I'll just say quality wise, the ramen is fine. But please... Stop using over-caramelized onions. It makes the broth so sweet it might as well be a desert. Staff here are fine. It's a mall restaurant, not a big deal. I don't have many complaints there. But the food.... It would be edible if you just stopped caramelizing the onions.
