Ramen is great and authentic, but what I really come here for is the Boba milk tea. Always delicous, always fresh, and like nothing else you can find in the valley. The staff are so nice and quick when you order, and they even have a loyalty card, which I will end up filling sooner rather than later! XD Love love this place. Definitely try it and I guarantee you'll be joining me for my weekly milk tea!
