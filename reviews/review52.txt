Great food and friendly owners. I came across this place while visiting my family in Logan, their bubble tea is on point. I am a picky person when it comes to bubble tea, I was surprised they use real fruit in my tea. They also have authentic Chinese food there, my husband and I ordered two steam buns and they are very yummy. This place will be my go to place next time when I come to Logan.
