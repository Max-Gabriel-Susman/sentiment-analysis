Pretty solid. Got the spicy tonkatsu. Not too spicy. The broth and pork belly were legit. Egg wasn’t seasoned much of any and yolk was too hard in my opinion. Expected a softer yolk for ramen. I think the toppings could be improved a little. Still overall, solid and I’d come back. They had other options like boba tea, fried rice, and gyoza. Definitely a nice spot in the mall.
