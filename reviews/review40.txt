I was pleasantly surprised at how good the ramen is here. It's not the fanciest ramen you'll ever have, but it's by far the best in Cache Valley. Great flavor, and wide variety of ingredients. Good boba as well. Hopefully the word gets out about this place because they deserve the business. We need ramen in Logan!
