Really really disappointed that this place is no longer CC boba. I don't know if they switched owners, or if its an entirely new business, but the boba has definitely gone down hill. I am from Taiwan so I know good boba. I ordered cheese cap twice and both times it was served in a normal straw lid. There's no point to serving a cheese cap if its not out of a lid you can sip from. I paid 7.50 for a little plastic cup with poor flavor/packaging. I'm really sad that the fun packaging of cc boba is gone.
All that being said, this is still the best boba place in Logan so if you want boba give it a visit. Ramen here is good.
