We were very surprised with our order! Wide variety of choices from drinks to food. We were all pleased with everything we ordered! Tasted less greasy than most Asian food. Our picky toddler even ate way more than she normally does.

We love that there is a fresh new alternative! Go check it out or door dash so we can support a great local business in a maybe not so popular location.

We need to keep business like this going so we have more options!
