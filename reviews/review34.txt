If you’re looking for an authentic spot, you found it! Amazing boba and their ramen is so flavorful and filling, it is so good! I got the brown sugar milk tea boba, and also tried the Thai iced tea boba, both were a 10/10. We’ve been waiting for a great boba place in Logan. Can’t beat the price! Highly recommend to ramen and boba lovers.
