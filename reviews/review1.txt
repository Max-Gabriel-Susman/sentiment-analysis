Owners are super friendly. I had the spicy ramen and brown sugar milk tea. The boba tea is one if the best I have had. I highly recommend it. The ramen had a beautiful presentation and tasted delicious. Highly recommended.

Update: Celiac friendly and absolutely delicious and refreshing is their poke bowl. Highly recommended!
