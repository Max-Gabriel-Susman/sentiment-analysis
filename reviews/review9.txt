This place is not good. Waited forever for a couple of watermelon bobba's. Watched the girl put maybe 1 tablespoon of watermelon flavoring in a huge blender for 2 large drinks and then just pack the ice in. I knew all it was going to taste like was ice but because she didn't even bother to rinse out the blender from the previous coffee bobba, ours tasted mostly like ice with a hint of coffee (remember, they were supposed to be watermelon). We paid $12 for a cup of chopped ice. Save your money and go somewhere that they care about the quality of the product. Do Better!!
