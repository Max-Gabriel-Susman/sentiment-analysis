Stop by the mall today and saw Akita thought I'd try out their boba and it was surprisingly good! I had the strawberry/kiwi/watermelon mix and my wife had the strawberry/mango mix!! Staff is friendly as well!! Its hard to find good boba close by we usually go to layton but we will be stopping by again for some more boba.
