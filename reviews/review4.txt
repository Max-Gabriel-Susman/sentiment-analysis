I really enjoyed my drink I got from there. The watermelon flavor was simply divine and the service was so done in a very timely manner. The barista was a literal angel. All of the staff was incredibly kind, and aided me in picking the most delicious items on their menu. I will definitely be back again! 10/10 recommend!
