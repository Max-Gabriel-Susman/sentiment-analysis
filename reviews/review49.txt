I love boba, Logan needed a boba place, unfortunately I was super disappointed. I like my boba shake style, you know like a smoothie or milk shake. I don't know if they just under blended it or have a bad blender but the ice didn't get blended enough and I was left with large crunchy ice chunks that had to be chewed. The flavor was ok, super mild, almost watered down. My favorite is taro and it was barely purple in color. It was miserable, worst boba drink I've ever had. The tapioca pearls were ok. I may try it again and if it's better I'll update.
