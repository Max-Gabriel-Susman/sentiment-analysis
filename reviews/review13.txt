I loved it! Me and my family have been there several times now and every time we have been wowed. Ive ordered the ramen and boba drinks several times and ive loved it every time. If your wondering what boba/ramen i would suggest is this:

Boba: Blueberry, Pineapple, Coffee (slushies)

Ive only had the tonkotso and i like the spicy more (probably didnt spell that right)

(Photo from the Coffee with milk & tea after 15 minutes tasted amazing)
