This review may be skewed because I have lived in Japan for the last 9 years. I got the Tonkotsu ramen. For starters, the spinach wasn't boiled, I've never seen this type of egg in any kind of ramen in Japan. The noodles were definitely instant (expected for this area), but were waaaaaay too soft. There was corn in tonkotsu bowl, in Japan corn is reserved for miso ramen. I have had better instant bowls of ramen at home in Japan. The soup was actually the best part. Overall decent, but not even close to being worth what you pay.
