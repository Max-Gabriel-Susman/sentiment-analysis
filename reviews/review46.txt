This place was great!!! The shop is super cute and the people are soooooo nice!! The food was delicious and the boba tea hit the spot! I lived in slc before and was so sad that I wouldn’t be able to drop in any where close to grab some tea, but they have this one and I love it! Obviously not as fancy as some others I’ve had, but great for what it is!!! (I got the brown sugar milk tea and would recommend!)
