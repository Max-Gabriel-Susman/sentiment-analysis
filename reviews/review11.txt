The blonde girl in the jorts was very rude and unwilling to help me or even make my food. She was more occupied talking to her friends or texting on her phone to actually get her job done. She rushed me taking my order and was unwilling to answer my questions. While the brown haired girl was preparing food for other customers and still giving better customer service even when she wasn't the cashier. I ordered the brown sugar boba drink and the first time it was sent out it took several minutes and when I got it it was just a cup of whole milk, confused I asked about it and the brown haired one quickly replaced my order with a much better drink, apparently the first drink had been made by the blonde one and she forgot to add any flavor, this was an outrage as i knew it was because she was too busy talking to her friends. Overall the customer service was lackluster due to the blonde girl, and something needs to change in order for akita to be a worthwhile restaurant.
