Disappointing. We came about 30 minutes before close (7:30 P.M.), and they were out of classic boba. Also, the gal making the drinks was being rather particular about what she would make or not. The girl taking my order was like, "you have to come at 5 if you want classic boba." Which just seems silly. Also, my drink was so overly sweet I had to ask for water and water it down. Overall it was a disappointing visit.
