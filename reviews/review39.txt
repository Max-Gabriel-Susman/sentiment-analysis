Having traveled the globe and considering myself somewhat of a 'ramen connoisseur', I have been seeking out the delicious ramen flavors I had in my time japan. This was not it. It tastes fine and the presentation was great. I love the additions.  but you can do this with packaged ramen.
However , the staff is great and friendly, and the boba drinks are delicious and refreshing. I will be back. But not for the ramen.
