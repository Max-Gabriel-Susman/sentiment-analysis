Definitely not your standard food court fair. I was pleasantly surprised by both the quality and portions. Service was a little slow, but that's because they're crazy busy and the broth seems to be the only thing that's sitting around waiting for an order. It was a little more expensive that I expected for the location, but the food justified it, at the end my tongue and my stomach were fully satisfied.
